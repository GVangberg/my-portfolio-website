                        I show off my fluffy belly but it's a trap! If you pet it it will tear up your hand jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed but hown on top of tall thing nap all day leave fur on owners clothes eat the rubberband. Meow meow chase red laser dot.

                <p> I am passionate about the web. </p>

                    I started taking Skillcrush classes after getting recommendations from my cat. Without her constant encouragement I would never have made it to be a purrfesional Web Developer. One day I will make the Internet a safe place for all cats, where no cat will fear being meme-ified and exploited for their cuteness.
